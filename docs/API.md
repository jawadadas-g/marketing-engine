# marketing-engine API

Every route the engine serves. Hand-written, so if something here is wrong it is
a bug in this file — say so.

## Conventions

- **Money is an integer in the currency's minor unit.** Halalas for SAR. Never
  a float, never a major unit. `80000` is 800.00 SAR.
- **A percent discount is basis points.** `1000` is 10%.
- **Phone numbers are E.164** (`+9665…`). Send a national number only with
  `defaultCountry` beside it (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2), or it is rejected.
- **`Idempotency-Key` is required** on `POST /v1/redemptions` and the settle and
  release routes, and accepted everywhere else. The same key with a different
  body is a 422, not a replay.
- **Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC.** IDs are UUIDs unless stated.
- Errors are `{ "error": "<code>", "message": "<human text>" }`. Validation
  failures add `detail` with the offending fields.

## Authentication

Three kinds, and a route takes exactly one.

**Tenant JWT** — `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` on everything under `/v1`. The
marketplace mints these itself with the shared `JWT_SECRET`; the engine never
issues a token. HS256, and the only claim the engine reads is `tenant_id`:

```ts
import { SignJWT } from 'jose';

const token = await new SignJWT({ tenant_id: tenantId, sub: externalRef })
  .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })
  .setIssuedAt()
  .setExpirationTime('15m')
  .sign(new TextEncoder().encode(process.env.JWT_SECRET));
```

**Internal token** — `X-Internal-Token: <INTERNAL_TOKEN>` on `/internal/*`.
The marketplace's own key. These calls create the tenants that JWTs name, so
they cannot be scoped by one.

**None** — the public routes carry their own secret in the URL or the body.

---

## Tenants

### `POST /internal/tenants` — internal token

Provision a tenant. Idempotent on `externalRef`: asking twice returns the same
tenant, because the marketplace will retry.

```json
{ "name": "Acme Supplies", "externalRef": "mkt-company-1" }
```

→ `201 { "tenantId": "<uuid>", "name": "Acme Supplies" }` on the first call,
`200` with the same body afterwards. Emits `tenant.created`.

Errors: `400` invalid body, `401` wrong token.

---

## Channels

### `PUT /v1/channels/:channel` — tenant JWT

`:channel` is `sms`, `whatsapp`, `email` or `telegram`. The credentials are
checked against the provider before they are stored, and encrypted at rest.

```json
{
  "provider": "taqnyat",
  "sender": "GASABLE-AD",
  "unsubscribeText": "Reply STOP to unsubscribe",
  "config": { "token": "…" }
}
```

`config` keys by provider:

| provider | channel | keys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `taqnyat` | sms | `token`, `baseUrl?` |
| `whatsapp-meta` | whatsapp | `accessToken`, `phoneNumberId`, `appSecret`, `apiVersion?` |
| `email-smtp` | email | `host`, `port`, `secure`, `user`, `pass`, `fromName?` |
| `telegram` | telegram | `botToken` |
| `fake` | all four | `token` (the value `"bad"` fails validation) |

→ `200 { "channel": { channel, provider, sender, unsubscribeText, configured, updatedAt } }`.
The credentials are never echoed. Emits `channel.configured`.

Errors: `400` invalid body, `422` `credentials_rejected` / `unknown_provider`.

### `GET /v1/channels/:channel` — tenant JWT

→ `200` with the same redacted shape, or `404`.

---

## Templates

### `PUT /v1/templates/:name` — tenant JWT

Liquid, rendered with `strictVariables`, so a missing variable is a 400 naming
it rather than an empty string sent to a real person.

```json
{
  "channel": "whatsapp",
  "body": "Hi {{ name }}",
  "subject": "Hello {{ name }}",
  "providerRef": { "name": "greet", "language": "ar", "params": ["name"] }
}
```

`subject` is required for `email`. `providerRef` is required for `whatsapp` and
names the Meta-approved template plus the order its positional parameters are
filled — Meta does not accept free text for business-initiated messages. A
template missing what its channel needs is `template_unfit`.

→ `200 { "template": { name, channel, body } }`. Emits `template.saved`.

Errors: `400` `template_invalid` (the Liquid does not parse).

---

## Messages

### `POST /v1/messages` — tenant JWT, `Idempotency-Key` accepted

An intent, not a channel command.

```json
{
  "contact": { "phone": "+9665…", "email": "a@b.co", "telegram": "123456789" },
  "channel": "whatsapp",
  "purpose": "marketing",
  "template": "order_update",
  "variables": { "order": "A-1043" },
  "defaultCountry": "SA",
  "evaluateAt": "2026-09-21T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Name a `channel` and that is the channel. Leave it out and the engine picks: it
asks suppression and consent of every channel the contact has both an address
and a configured provider for, lets a `channel_selection` rule order what is
left, and applies the sending window to the one it picks. The rest become the
fallback order. `evaluateAt` pins the clock the sending window and rules are
checked against, for testing. **It does not delay the send**: the message is
queued now either way. To send later, use a campaign.

`at` is the deprecated name for `evaluateAt`, accepted for one release and then
removed. When both are given, `evaluateAt` wins.

The older `{ "channel", "address" }` pair is still accepted and folded into a
contact. It will be removed.

→ `202 { "message": … }` when queued, `200` when `can_send` refused — a refusal
is an answer, not an error. The message carries `status`, `blockedReason`,
`fallbackChannels`, `parentMessageId` and the rendered `body`.

Statuses: `blocked`, `queued`, `sent`, `delivered`, `read`, `failed`.
Block reasons: `no_channel` (with each channel's reason in the
`message.blocked` event), or a specific one on a named channel.

Errors: `400` `address_missing` / `template_variable_missing`, `404`
`template_not_found`, `409` `channel_not_configured`, `422`
`unsubscribe_text_required` / `template_unfit`.

### `GET /v1/messages/:id` — tenant JWT

→ `200 { "message": … }` or `404`.

---

## Consent and suppression

### `POST /v1/consent` — tenant JWT

```json
{ "channel": "sms", "address": "+9665…", "purpose": "marketing",
  "status": "granted", "source": "signup-form", "defaultCountry": "SA" }
```

Append-only: the latest row for a contact and purpose wins, so a revoke after a
grant refuses. → `201 { "consent": … }`. Emits `consent.granted` / `consent.revoked`.

### `POST /v1/suppression` — tenant JWT

```json
{ "channel": "email", "address": "a@b.co", "reason": "complaint" }
```

→ `201 { "suppression": … }`. Emits `suppression.added`. Platform-wide blocks
exist but are not writable through the API.

### `GET /v1/can-send?channel=&address=&purpose=&at=&defaultCountry=` — tenant JWT

A dry run; sends nothing.

→ `200 { "allowed": true }` or
`{ "allowed": false, "reason": "suppressed" | "no_consent" | "rule", "rule": { id, name } }`.

The order is fixed and the first failure wins: suppression (an opt-out beats
everything, including a transactional message), then consent for `marketing`
only, then region-scoped `sending_window` rules in the contact's own local time.

---

## Rules

### `GET /v1/rules` — tenant JWT

→ `200 { "rules": [ … ] }`: platform, region and this tenant's own.

### `POST /v1/rules` — tenant JWT

```json
{ "kind": "sending_window", "name": "no-fridays",
  "document": { "==": [{ "var": "weekday" }, "fri"] } }
```

`kind` is `sending_window` or `channel_selection`. → `201 { "rule": … }`.

**Two senses, and they differ.** A `sending_window` rule *denies* when its
document is true. A `channel_selection` rule *returns a value* — an ordered
array of channels — and the most specific scope wins, so a tenant can reorder
its own channels but never lift a platform restriction, because every channel
returned still has to pass `can_send`. A promocode's own `rules` document is
different again: it says when the code *may* be used, so anything but `true`
refuses it.

### `DELETE /v1/rules/:id` — tenant JWT

Deletes only this tenant's own rule. A platform or region rule reads as `404`.
→ `204` or `404`.

---

## Companies

The prospect pool: companies **not** on the marketplace. `companies` and
`company_identifiers` are shared across tenants; what a tenant says *about* a
company is private to it.

### `POST /v1/companies` — tenant JWT

```json
{
  "name": "شركة الفلاح للتجارة",
  "country": "SA",
  "identifiers": [{ "type": "cr", "value": "1010123456" }],
  "source": { "type": "rfq", "ref": "RFQ-9" },
  "enrich": true,
  "defaultCountry": "SA",
  "tenantView": { "relationship": "prospect", "tags": ["vip"], "notes": "…" }
}
```

`source.type` is `rfq`, `import` or `api`. Identifier types are `cr`, `vat`,
`domain` (strong: they merge) and `phone`, `email` (weak: they link). An email
also yields its domain. `enrich: true` asks the registrar about a `cr` first,
when a lookup is configured.

→ `201 { "company", "created", "mergedFrom": [ … ] }`. Emits `company.created`
or `company.updated`, and `company.merged` when two records turn out to be one.

### `GET /v1/companies/:id` — tenant JWT

Follows a merge: asking for a merged-away id returns the survivor.

→ `200 { "company", "identifiers", "tenantView", "sources" }` or `404`.
`tenantView` and `sources` are yours only.

### `GET /v1/companies?identifier=cr:1010123456` — tenant JWT

Same shape, found by identifier. The value is normalised before matching.

### `PUT /v1/companies/:id/view` — tenant JWT

```json
{ "relationship": "customer", "tags": ["gold"], "notes": "…" }
```

→ `200 { "view": … }`. Yours; another tenant gets its own.

### `PUT /v1/companies/:id/profile` — tenant JWT

```json
{ "buys": ["diesel"], "sells": [], "sector": "energy", "city": "Riyadh", "size": "50-200" }
```

Shared, like the company. Category codes are free strings; the engine owns no
catalogue and validates nothing against one. → `200 { "profile": … }`. Emits
`company.profiled`.

### `POST /v1/companies/import` — tenant JWT, `Content-Type: text/csv`

Up to 5,000 rows. Header exactly:

```
name,country,cr,vat,domain,phone,email,relationship,tags
```

optionally followed by `,buys,sells,sector,city`. List columns are
`;`-separated. `?ref=<name>` labels the import; each row's source reference
becomes `<ref>:<line>`.

→ `200 { "rows", "created", "linked", "merged", "rejected": [{ row, reason }] }`.
A row that offered identifiers and had none survive normalisation is rejected
with its line number: nothing could ever match it.

---

## Discovery

### `POST /v1/discovery/search` — tenant JWT

```json
{ "buys": ["diesel"], "sector": "energy", "city": "Riyadh", "country": "SA",
  "text": "الفلاح", "excludeCompanyIds": [], "limit": 20 }
```

→ `200 { "finder", "finderRunId", "candidates": [{ company, profile, view, score, reasons }] }`.

`score` is 0..1 and comparable within one finder, not between finders. Every
search is logged; **pass `finderRunId` back on an invite** so the search can be
judged by its outcome.

**The matching algorithm is a placeholder.** `basic` is an AND of exact filters
plus trigram matching on the name, so everything it returns matched everything
asked and scores 1.0. Companies already on the marketplace, and merged-away
ones, are never returned.

### `POST /v1/companies/:id/invite` — tenant JWT

```json
{ "contact": { "phone": "+9665…" }, "channel": "sms", "template": "invite",
  "variables": {}, "expiresInDays": 14, "finderRunId": 42 }
```

The template gets `invite_url`. An invite is a transactional message, so consent
and the sending rules apply to it like anything else.

→ `202 { "invite", "message" }`, or `200 { "invite": null, "message": … }` when
`can_send` refused — no invite row is written. Emits `invite.sent`.

### `GET /v1/invites/:id` — tenant JWT

→ `200 { "invite": … }` or `404`.

---

## Promocodes

### `POST /v1/promocodes` — tenant JWT

```json
{
  "code": "SAVE10",
  "currency": "SAR",
  "discount": { "type": "percent", "value": 1000, "maxDiscount": 5000, "minSubtotal": 20000 },
  "budget": { "maxSpend": 500000, "maxUses": 100, "perBuyerMaxUses": 1 },
  "funders": [{ "party": "platform", "share": 0.6 }, { "party": "tenant:<uuid>", "share": 0.4 }],
  "rules": { ">=": [{ "var": "cart.subtotal" }, 100000] },
  "startsAt": "…", "endsAt": "…"
}
```

Funder shares sum to 1. A discount that does not divide evenly puts the
remainder on the first funder, so the parts always sum exactly.

→ `201 { "promocode": … }`. Emits `promo.created`.

Errors: `400` `invalid_currency` / `invalid_funders` / `invalid_discount`.

### `GET /v1/promocodes?status=` · `GET /v1/promocodes/:id` · `PATCH /v1/promocodes/:id`

List carries `usage: { uses, spend }`. `PATCH` takes `{ "status": "active" | "paused" | "ended" }`.

### `POST /v1/promocodes/validate` — tenant JWT

```json
{ "code": "SAVE10", "buyerRef": "cust-1", "companyId": null,
  "cart": { "currency": "SAR", "subtotal": 80000,
            "items": [{ "sku": "lpg", "qty": 1, "unitPrice": 80000 }] } }
```

→ `200 { "valid": true, "discountAmount": 5000, "promocodeId": … }` or
`200 { "valid": false, "reason": … }`. Reasons, first true one wins:
`not_found`, `not_active`, `currency_mismatch`, `min_subtotal`, `rule`,
`budget_uses`, `budget_buyer`, `budget_spend`. Writes nothing.

### `POST /v1/redemptions` — tenant JWT, **`Idempotency-Key` required**

The validate body plus `orderRef` and optional `ttlMinutes`. Locks the code and
re-checks everything, so two checkouts racing for the last use cannot both pass.
`orderRef` is the natural key: the same order twice returns the same redemption
and one set of holds.

→ `201 { "redemption": … }` or `200 { "valid": false, "reason": … }`.
Emits `promo.reserved`.

### `POST /v1/redemptions/:id/settle` — tenant JWT, **`Idempotency-Key` required**

`{ "finalDiscountAmount": 2500 }` — optional, and never above what was reserved.
Captures what was used and releases what was not, so no hold is left open.

→ `200 { "redemption": … }`. Emits `promo.settled`. `409` from any state but
`reserved`.

### `POST /v1/redemptions/:id/release` — tenant JWT, **`Idempotency-Key` required**

`{ "reason": "cancelled" }` → `200`. Emits `promo.released`. `409` from
`settled`: a refund is a marketplace matter. Reservations nobody settles or
releases are let go automatically after `RESERVATION_TTL_MINUTES`.

### `GET /v1/redemptions/:id` · `GET /v1/redemptions?orderRef=`

→ `200 { "redemption": … }` or `404`.

### `GET /v1/promocodes/reconcile` — tenant JWT

→ `200 { "reconciliation": [{ currency, settled: { redemptions, ledger, agrees },
outstanding: { redemptions, ledger, agrees } }] }`. Both `agrees` should be
true; if either is false, the ledger and the redemptions disagree and something
is wrong.

---

## Contacts

A stored contact: any of a phone, email and Telegram id, with a name, locale,
free `attributes` and an optional link to a company. Addresses are stored
normalised and are unique per tenant, so the same number cannot land twice.
Storing a contact never records consent.

### `POST /v1/contacts` — tenant JWT

```json
{ "phone": "+9665…", "email": "a@b.co", "telegram": "123456789",
  "name": "Amal", "locale": "ar-SA", "attributes": { "tags": ["vip"] },
  "companyId": "…", "defaultCountry": "SA" }
```

Upserts: a contact that already has any of these addresses is filled in
(given fields overwrite, `attributes` merge) rather than duplicated. Without a
`companyId`, the contact is linked to whichever registry company owns its phone
or email, if one does.

→ `201 { "contact", "created": true }`, `200` when an existing one was updated.
`409 contact_ambiguous` with `contactIds` when the addresses belong to two
different contacts — the engine never merges contacts on its own. Emits
`contact.upserted`.

### `POST /v1/contacts/import?defaultCountry=SA` — tenant JWT, `Content-Type: text/csv`

The header must be exactly:

```
phone,email,telegram,name,company_cr,attributes,consent_channels,consent_purpose,consent_source,consent_date
```

- `attributes` is a JSON object, `consent_channels` is `;`-separated
  (`sms;whatsapp`), `consent_purpose` is `marketing` or `transactional`,
  `consent_source` describes the evidence ("signed supply agreement
  2026-03-11"), `consent_date` is an ISO date, not in the future.
- **A row with the consent columns filled records consent** for each channel,
  with that source, dated `consent_date`. **A row without them imports the
  contact and records nothing**: marketing to it stays blocked until consent
  arrives. Consent is never inferred from having an address. A row with only
  some of the four columns is rejected.
- `company_cr` links the contact to the registry company holding that CR, if
  there is one.

Up to 20,000 rows, in batches of 500 that each commit on their own, so one bad
row or batch cannot roll back the file.

→ `200 { "rows", "contactsCreated", "contactsUpdated", "consentRecorded",
"rejected": [{ "row": 7, "reason": "…" }] }`. Row numbers count the header as
row 1.

### `GET /v1/contacts?q=&companyId=&limit=&cursor=` · `GET /v1/contacts/:id` · `PATCH /v1/contacts/:id`

`q` matches name, phone, email or Telegram id. Lists are newest first, paged by
`cursor` (the last row's `id`). `PATCH` takes the same fields as `POST`;
an address another contact already has is `409 contact_conflict`.

---

## Audiences

A named group of contacts, of one of two kinds:

- **`static`** — an explicit member list.
- **`search`** — a definition resolved every time it is used:

  ```json
  { "finderQuery": { "buys": ["diesel"], "city": "Riyadh" },
    "contactFilter": { "hasChannel": ["sms", "whatsapp"], "tags": ["vip"], "companyIds": ["…"] } }
  ```

  The active finder runs (the same one as `/v1/discovery/search`, and logged the
  same way), and the audience is this tenant's contacts linked to the companies
  it returns. `hasChannel` keeps contacts with an address for any of those
  channels; `tags` matches `attributes.tags`. A company that joins the
  marketplace drops out, as it does from search.

### `POST /v1/audiences` — tenant JWT

`{ "name": "diesel buyers", "kind": "static" }` or
`{ "name": "…", "kind": "search", "definition": {…} }`. Names are unique per
tenant (`409 audience_exists`).

### `GET /v1/audiences` · `GET /v1/audiences/:id` · `PATCH /v1/audiences/:id` · `DELETE /v1/audiences/:id`

`members` is the member count for a static audience, `null` for a search.
`PATCH` takes `name` and, for a search audience, `definition`. `DELETE` is
`409 audience_in_use` while a campaign points at it.

### `POST /v1/audiences/:id/members` — tenant JWT

`{ "contactIds": ["…"] }` → `{ "added", "unknown": [ids this tenant does not have] }`.

Or `Content-Type: text/csv` with any of the columns `phone,email,telegram,name`
(and `?defaultCountry=`): each row is upserted as a contact first, so an address
nobody has stored becomes a contact, **with no consent**.
→ `{ "added", "contactsCreated", "rejected": [{ "row", "reason" }] }`.

Static audiences only (`400 not_static`).

### `DELETE /v1/audiences/:id/members/:contactId`

→ `204`, or `404`.

### `POST /v1/audiences/:id/preview?limit=20&purpose=marketing&channel=&evaluateAt=` — tenant JWT

**The honest answer to "who will actually get this".** Show it before
scheduling anything.

```json
{
  "total": 3, "sampled": 3, "sendable": 1,
  "contacts": [
    { "id": "…", "name": "Amal", "phone": "+1415…", "email": null, "telegram": null,
      "allowed": true, "channel": "sms", "reason": null },
    { "id": "…", "allowed": false, "channel": null, "reason": "suppressed" },
    { "id": "…", "allowed": false, "channel": null, "reason": "no_consent" }
  ]
}
```

`total` is the whole audience; `contacts` are the first `limit` of it (by
contact id), each with the verdict `send()` would give for `purpose` on its best
channel — the same consent, suppression, rules and channel selection, with
nothing written. `sendable` counts the allowed ones **among those sampled**.
`channel` pins the channel as a campaign with a channel would. `evaluateAt`
judges the sending window at another time, e.g. when the campaign will run.

---

## Campaigns

A campaign is a scheduler and a recipient list, nothing more. Every recipient
goes through `messaging.send()` exactly as `POST /v1/messages` does: consent,
rules, channel selection, templates, fallback and the event log all apply.

### `POST /v1/campaigns` — tenant JWT

```json
{
  "name": "Monday diesel offer",
  "audienceId": "…",
  "template": "diesel_offer",
  "channel": "whatsapp",
  "purpose": "marketing",
  "variables": { "offer": "5%" },
  "scheduledAt": "2026-10-01T07:00:00Z",
  "recurrence": { "cron": "0 10 * * 1", "endsAt": "2026-12-31T00:00:00Z", "maxRuns": 12 },
  "timezone": "Asia/Riyadh",
  "throttlePerMinute": 60
}
```

- `channel` null or absent: selection picks per recipient.
- `scheduledAt` absent on a one-shot: runs as soon as it is scheduled. On a
  recurrence it means "not before".
- `recurrence.cron` is a standard five-field cron (numbers, `*`, lists,
  ranges, steps) read in `timezone`. `null` is a one-shot.
- `throttlePerMinute` is 1..600, default 60 — a per-campaign send rate, because
  a supplier firing 5,000 WhatsApp messages in a minute gets their number
  flagged.
- The template gets the campaign's `variables` plus `contact` (`id`, `name`,
  `locale`, `phone`, `email`, `telegram`, `attributes`, and `address`, the one
  it went to) and `company` (`id`, `name`, `country`, or null).

Created as a `draft`. Errors: `400 template_not_found` (for the named channel,
or — with no channel — for any channel the tenant has a provider for, listed in
`missing`), `400 invalid_cron`, `400 invalid_timezone`, `400 scheduled_at_past`,
`404 audience_not_found`. Emits `campaign.created`.

### `GET /v1/campaigns?status=` · `GET /v1/campaigns/:id` · `PATCH /v1/campaigns/:id`

Each campaign carries `status`, `nextRunAt` and `lastRun` (the newest run's
counts, below). `PATCH` takes any create field and is draft-only
(`409 not_draft`).

Statuses: `draft`, `scheduled`, `running`, `paused`, `done`, `cancelled`,
`failed`.

### `POST /v1/campaigns/:id/schedule`

`draft` → `scheduled`, with the first run on the queue for `scheduledAt` (or
now), or for the next cron time.

- `400 audience_empty` — a `marketing` campaign whose audience has nobody
  sendable at the time it would run. It refuses rather than running and
  blocking everyone; preview the audience to see why.
- `409 too_many_running` — the tenant already has 5 campaigns `running`.
- `400 scheduled_at_past`, `400 recurrence_never_fires`, `409 not_draft`.

### `POST /v1/campaigns/:id/pause` · `/resume` · `/cancel`

- **pause**: `scheduled` or `running` → `paused`. Nothing more is sent; pending
  recipients stay pending.
- **resume**: `paused` → `running` if a run was in progress (its batches pick
  up where they stopped), else `scheduled`.
- **cancel**: any live state → `cancelled`. The run in progress is `cancelled`
  and its pending recipients `skipped` with reason `cancelled`. Messages already
  queued are real sends and are not recalled.

A wrong state is `409 invalid_state`.

### `GET /v1/campaigns/:id/runs`

```json
{ "items": [{ "id": "…", "runNo": 2, "status": "sending",
              "startedAt": "…", "finishedAt": null,
              "audienceSize": 500, "queued": 140, "blocked": 18, "skipped": 2,
              "pending": 340, "deferred": 120, "error": null }] }
```

Newest first. Run statuses: `expanding`, `sending`, `done`, `cancelled`,
`failed`. The counts update as the run sends. `deferred` is the part of
`pending` waiting on a sending window (pending with `notBefore` in the future).
The same counts appear on each campaign's `lastRun` and on
`/internal/campaigns`.

### `GET /v1/campaigns/:id/runs/:runId/recipients?state=&limit=&cursor=`

Who got it, who didn't, and why, in one call:

```json
{ "items": [{ "contactId": "…", "name": "…", "phone": "…", "email": null, "telegram": null,
              "state": "blocked", "reason": "no_consent", "notBefore": null, "messageId": "…",
              "message": { "channel": "sms", "status": "blocked", "blockedReason": "no_channel",
                           "error": null, "updatedAt": "…" } }],
  "nextCursor": null }
```

States: `pending` (not sent yet), `queued` (a message went on the queue;
`message.status` says how it has fared since), `blocked` (`send()` refused;
terminal, never retried), `skipped` (could not be sent at all — no template for
the channel picked, no unsubscribe text, a missing variable — or cancelled).
Ordered by contact id; the cursor is the last `contactId`.

`notBefore` is set on a `pending` recipient a sending window is holding back:
it will not be tried before then.

Reasons worth knowing:

| Reason | State | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deferred:<rule>` | `pending` | Only the sending-window rule `<rule>` held it back. It waits until `notBefore`, the next 15-minute mark when the window is open; nothing was sent and no message row exists. |
| `no_sending_window` | `blocked` | Held back by a sending window that does not open in the next 7 days. |
| `error:<message>` | `skipped` | Sending to it threw something unexpected three times (the first 200 characters of the error). |
| `cancelled` | `skipped` | The campaign was cancelled before it was sent, deferred ones included. |
| `no_consent`, `suppressed`, … | `blocked` | `send()` refused, as for any single send. Consent and suppression are never deferred. |

### How a run works

1. At its time, `campaign.run` opens run *n* and **snapshots** the audience into
   recipients. Next Monday's run sends to next Monday's audience and never
   re-sends this Monday's. For a recurrence, run *n+1* is queued now, before
   anything is sent, so a long run cannot push the next one back.
2. `campaign.batch` takes pending recipients that are ready now and runs each
   through the same check `send()` makes. One held back only by a sending
   window (a quiet hour) is **deferred**, not blocked: it stays `pending` with
   `notBefore` set and reason `deferred:<rule>`. Everyone else is sent, blocked
   or skipped, up to `ceil(throttlePerMinute / 6)` per batch; deferring does not
   count against that. The next batch is queued ten seconds later while anyone
   is ready, or for the earliest `notBefore` when only deferred recipients are
   left. When none are pending the run is `done`, and the campaign `done`
   (one-shot, or a recurrence past `maxRuns` or `endsAt`) or back to
   `scheduled`.
3. Recipients are the retry unit: a batch that dies leaves its unsent
   recipients pending for the next. A recipient that throws something
   unexpected three times is `skipped` as `error:…`. A run that fails to expand
   is `failed`, and so is the campaign; one recipient failing never fails a run.
4. `campaign.sweep` runs every five minutes and picks up runs whose job chain
   died after pg-boss gave up on it: an `expanding` run idle for 10 minutes is
   re-expanded, a `sending` run with ready recipients idle for 5 minutes gets a
   new batch, and a `sending` run with nothing pending is finished. Each one
   emits `campaign.run.recovered`. A run waiting on deferred recipients is left
   alone.

Messages a campaign sent carry `campaignRunId` (on `GET /v1/messages/:id` too).

## Events

### `POST /v1/events` — tenant JWT

`{ "type", "subjectType", "subjectId", "payload" }` → `201 { "event": … }`.

### `GET /v1/events?type=&since=&limit=` — tenant JWT

→ `200 { "events": [ … ] }`, newest first. Append-only: nothing edits or
deletes an event.

---

## Webhooks out

### `POST /v1/webhooks` — tenant JWT

```json
{ "url": "https://marketplace.example.com/hooks/engine", "eventTypes": ["promo.settled"] }
```

Omit `eventTypes` for every event. The URL must be `https` unless the engine
itself is running on `http`.

→ `201 { "webhook": { id, url, eventTypes, active, createdAt }, "secret": "…" }`.
**The secret is shown once.** It is not retrievable; losing it means creating a
new endpoint.

### `GET /v1/webhooks` · `DELETE /v1/webhooks/:id`

→ `200 { "webhooks": [ … ] }` (no secrets) · `204` or `404`.

### `GET /v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries?status=` — tenant JWT

→ `200 { "deliveries": [ … ] }`, newest first, up to 200. Status is `pending`,
`delivered` or `failed`.

### `POST /v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries/:deliveryId/replay` — tenant JWT

→ `202 { "delivery": … }`, reset to `pending` and queued again.

### `POST /internal/webhooks` — internal token

The platform endpoint: hears every tenant's events, belongs to none, invisible
to all of them. Same body and response.

---

## Public routes

### `GET /i/:token`

The invite link. → `302` to `{MARKETPLACE_SIGNUP_URL}?invite=<token>` while the
invite is open, `410` once it is used or expired.

### `POST /internal/invites/accept` — internal token

`{ "token": "<invite token>", "ref": "<marketplace account id>" }` →
`200 { "companyId", "tenantId" }`. Marks the invite accepted, stamps the company
as on-platform, expires the company's other open invites, emits
`invite.accepted`. `409` if already accepted or expired, `404` if unknown.

### `POST` / `GET /unsubscribe/:token`

One-click opt-out from a marketing email's `List-Unsubscribe` header. The token
is an HMAC over tenant, channel and address, so there is no table behind it.
→ `200` (or a plain confirmation page on `GET`), `404` if tampered. Writes both
a suppression and a revoked consent.

### `POST` / `GET /webhooks/:provider/:token`

Provider callbacks; see below. → `202` almost always; `401` only for a bad
WhatsApp signature; `404` for a wrong token or unknown provider.

### `GET /health`

→ `200 { ok, db, boss, version }`, or `503` when the database is unreachable.

## What the marketplace has to implement

### 1. The invite handshake

1. Call `POST /v1/companies/:id/invite`. The engine sends a message containing
   `{PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/i/<token>`.
2. The invited company follows that link; the engine redirects to
   `{MARKETPLACE_SIGNUP_URL}?invite=<token>`.
3. **Your signup form carries `invite` through** to the account it creates.
4. Once the account exists, call `POST /internal/invites/accept` with
   `{ token, ref }` and your internal token.

From then on the company is out of the prospect pool's results.

### 2. The checkout handshake

1. **Validate at the cart** — `POST /v1/promocodes/validate` while the buyer is
   still typing. A refusal is a 200 with a reason.
2. **Reserve at order placed** — `POST /v1/redemptions` with an `orderRef` and
   an `Idempotency-Key`.
3. **Settle at order completed** — `POST /v1/redemptions/:id/settle`, with
   `finalDiscountAmount` if the order shrank.
4. **Release on cancel** — `POST /v1/redemptions/:id/release`.

Reconcile whenever you like; both `agrees` should always be true.

### 3. Receiving webhooks

Deliveries follow [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com), so any
library for it verifies them. Body:

```json
{ "id": "<event id>", "type": "promo.settled", "tenantId": "<uuid>",
  "occurredAt": "2026-09-21T10:00:00Z", "data": { } }
```

Headers: `webhook-id` (the delivery id), `webhook-timestamp` (unix seconds),
`webhook-signature` (`v1,<base64 hmac>`).

```ts
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from 'node:crypto';

function verify(secret: string, headers: Record<string, string>, body: string): boolean {
  const timestamp = Number(headers['webhook-timestamp']);
  // Reject anything older than five minutes, or a replayed body is accepted
  // forever.
  if (Math.abs(Date.now() / 1000 - timestamp) > 300) return false;

  const expected = `v1,${createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(`${headers['webhook-id']}.${timestamp}.${body}`)
    .digest('base64')}`;

  const a = Buffer.from(headers['webhook-signature'] ?? '');
  const b = Buffer.from(expected);
  return a.length === b.length && timingSafeEqual(a, b);
}
```

Answer `2xx`. Anything else is retried at 1m, 5m, 30m, 2h and 12h, then marked
failed and left for a manual replay. **Verify the timestamp**: the signature
alone does not stop an old body being replayed at you.

### 4. Registering the provider webhooks

Both use `{PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/webhooks/<provider>/<WEBHOOK_TOKEN>`.

- **WhatsApp (Meta)** — set it as the callback URL with `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` as the
  verify token. Meta GETs it once and expects the challenge echoed, which the
  engine does. Meta signs every payload; a bad signature is the one case a
  provider gets a 401.
- **Telegram** — register with the secret header:

  ```bash
  curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
    -d "url={PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/webhooks/telegram/<WEBHOOK_TOKEN>" \
    -d "secret_token=<WEBHOOK_TOKEN>"
  ```

- **Taqnyat** — set the delivery-report URL in their dashboard. Their callback
  shape is not in their OpenAPI spec, so the parser is deliberately permissive.
- **SMTP** — no callbacks. A sent email stays `sent`.

---

## Operator routes — internal token

The platform read side, across every tenant. `docs/DASHBOARD.md` is the guide
for building against these; this is the reference.

All of them take `X-Internal-Token`. A tenant JWT is a 401. Lists take `limit`
(1..500, default 100) and `cursor` (the last row's `id`) and return
`{ items, nextCursor }`, newest first. Windows are `since`/`until`, or
`window=1h|24h|7d|30d`.

### `GET /internal/overview?window=24h`

Everything a dashboard's front page needs, in one call:

```json
{
  "asOf": "…", "window": { "since": "…", "until": "…" },
  "health": { "db": true, "boss": "running (3 queued)", "version": "0.1.0" },
  "queue": [{ "name": "message.send", "created": 3, "active": 1, "retry": 2,
              "failed": 0, "cancelled": 0, "completedInWindow": 412 }],
  "messages": { "queued": 3, "sent": 200, "delivered": 180, "read": 40, "failed": 4, "blocked": 12 },
  "blockedReasons": { "no_consent": 9, "suppressed": 1, "rule:sa-marketing-sms-hours": 2 },
  "tenants": [{ "tenantId": "…", "tenantName": "…", "messages": {…},
                "invites": { "sent": 5, "accepted": 1 },
                "redemptions": { "reserved": 2, "settled": 9, "released": 1 },
                "webhookFailures": 0 }],
  "webhooks": { "pending": 1, "failed": 2 },
  "reservations": { "open": 2, "expiringWithin15m": 1 },
  "discovery": { "searches": 33, "invitesFromSearch": 4 },
  "campaigns": { "scheduled": 2, "running": 1, "recipientsPending": 340,
                 "sentInWindow": 1200, "blockedInWindow": 45 }
}
```

`blockedReasons` counts the reason *per channel* from the `message.blocked`
event payload, not the `blocked_reason` column — that column says `no_channel`
for almost every block and would tell you nothing.

`campaigns.sentInWindow` and `blockedInWindow` count campaign messages created
in the window; `recipientsPending` is across every run still in progress.

`queue` comes from pg-boss's own tables; `completedInWindow` reads its archive
too, because finished jobs move there.

### `GET /internal/tenants` · `GET /internal/tenants/:id`

The list carries each tenant's 24-hour counts. The detail adds channels
(redacted), template names, rule counts by kind, webhook endpoints (never the
secret) and counts over 24h, 7d and 30d.

### Feeds

| Route | Filters |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /internal/events` | `tenantId`, `type` (trailing `*` is a prefix), `subjectType`, `subjectId` |
| `GET /internal/events/:id` | one event with its full payload |
| `GET /internal/messages` | `tenantId`, `status`, `channel`, `provider`, `companyId`, `address` |
| `GET /internal/messages/:id` | the message, its events, delivery reports with raw provider bodies, fallback children and parent |
| `GET /internal/redemptions` | `tenantId`, `status`, `promocodeId` |
| `GET /internal/invites` | `tenantId`, `status` |
| `GET /internal/companies` | `q` (trigram on the normalised name), `country`, `onPlatform` |
| `GET /internal/webhook-deliveries` | `status`, `tenantId`, `endpointId` |
| `GET /internal/campaigns` | `tenantId`, `status`; each row has `tenantName`, `audienceName`, `nextRunAt` and `lastRun` with its counts |
| `GET /internal/campaigns/:id` | `{ campaign, runs }`, every run with its counts |
| `GET /internal/campaigns/:id/runs/:runId/recipients` | `state`; each recipient with its message's channel and status. Ordered by contact id |

Each message row carries a `timeline` of its own events in order, so a list
answers "what happened to this?" without opening it.

### Queue

- `GET /internal/jobs?name&state` → pg-boss rows: `id`, `name`, `state`,
  `retryCount`, `retryLimit`, `data`, `output`, `createdOn`, `startedOn`,
  `completedOn`, plus `tenantId`/`tenantName` when the job's data names a
  message or delivery.
- `GET /internal/jobs/:id` → one job.
- `POST /internal/jobs/:id/retry` → `200 { "retried": id }` for a `failed` job,
  `409` for any other state, `404` if unknown.
- `GET /internal/schedules` → the crons with `cron`, `timezone`, `data`, and
  when each last completed with what outcome.

### Actions

- `POST /internal/webhook-deliveries/:id/replay` → `202`, any tenant including
  the platform endpoint.

### `GET /internal/metrics`

`series=messages|events|redemptions|searches`, `bucket=hour|day`, optional
`tenantId` and `groupBy` (`status`/`channel` for messages, `status` for
redemptions, `type` for events).

→ `{ bucket, series: [{ key, points: [["2026-09-21T10:00:00Z", 12], …] }] }`

### `GET /internal/stream`

Server-Sent Events, one frame per event as it commits. Optional `tenantId` and
`type` (trailing `*` is a prefix).

```
id: 48213
event: message.sent
data: {"id":"48213","type":"message.sent","tenantId":"…","subjectType":"message", …}
```

Send `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect and the engine replays what you missed (up to
1000 rows) before going live. A heartbeat comment arrives every 15 seconds. At
most 20 concurrent streams; the 21st gets `503 too_many_streams`. The payload
is small by design — `GET /internal/events/:id` has the rest.

Events reach the stream only when their transaction commits, so nothing you see
here was later rolled back.

## Event types

`tenant.created` · `channel.configured` · `template.saved` · `consent.granted` ·
`consent.revoked` · `suppression.added` · `message.queued` · `message.blocked` ·
`message.sent` · `message.delivered` · `message.read` · `message.failed` ·
`message.replied` · `message.fallback` · `company.created` · `company.updated` ·
`company.merged` · `company.profiled` · `discovery.searched` · `invite.sent` ·
`invite.accepted` · `promo.created` · `promo.reserved` · `promo.settled` ·
`promo.released` · `contact.upserted` · `audience.saved` · `audience.deleted` ·
`campaign.created` · `campaign.scheduled` · `campaign.run.started` ·
`campaign.run.finished` (payload: `runId`, `runNo`, `audienceSize`, `queued`,
`blocked`, `skipped`) · `campaign.paused` · `campaign.resumed` ·
`campaign.cancelled` · `campaign.failed` · `campaign.done` ·
`campaign.run.recovered` (payload: `runId`, `runNo`, `action` — one of
`resume_expansion`, `enqueue_batch`, `finish`)

A campaign's individual sends emit the usual `message.*` events; there is no
per-recipient campaign event.

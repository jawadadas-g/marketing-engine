# Building the operator dashboard

For whoever builds the admin screen in the marketplace. The engine serves the
data; it owns no HTML and never will.

**The one rule: the admin renders, the engine decides.** If a number needs
computing, a state needs interpreting, or a decision needs making, it happens
in the engine and arrives as a field. A dashboard that recomputes something the
engine already knows will eventually disagree with it, and then nobody knows
which is right.

## Authentication

Every endpoint here is under `/internal/` and takes `X-Internal-Token: <INTERNAL_TOKEN>`
— the marketplace's own key, not a tenant JWT. A tenant JWT on these routes is
a 401. **The dashboard must call these from its own server, never from a
browser**: the internal token opens every tenant's data.

## Conventions

- Lists take `limit` (1..500, default 100) and `cursor` (the last row's `id`),
  return `{ items, nextCursor }`, newest first. `nextCursor` is `null` on the
  last page. Never an offset: rows arrive while you page, and an offset would
  skip and repeat them.
- Windows are `since`/`until` ISO timestamps, or `window=1h|24h|7d|30d` as
  shorthand for `since = now - window`.
- Cross-tenant rows carry `tenantId` and `tenantName`.
- Secrets never appear. Channel configs come back redacted exactly as the
  tenant's own `GET` returns them, and webhook endpoints never include their
  signing secret.

## The views

### 1. Overview

**`GET /internal/overview?window=24h`**, polled every 10 seconds.

One call fills the whole screen: health, per-queue job counts, message counts
by status, why messages were blocked, a row per tenant, webhook pending and
failed, open reservations and how many expire within fifteen minutes, and
discovery search counts.

Nothing is cached, so what it says is true at `asOf`. Render `blockedReasons`
prominently — `no_consent`, `suppressed`, `rule:<name>` — because that is where
a misconfigured tenant shows up first.

### 2. Live feed

**`GET /internal/stream`**, Server-Sent Events. Optional `tenantId` and `type`
(a trailing `*` is a prefix: `message.*`).

```
id: 48213
event: message.sent
data: {"id":"48213","type":"message.sent","tenantId":"…","subjectType":"message", …}
```

- Use `EventSource`, or any SSE client, from your server.
- **Send `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect.** The engine replays what you missed from
  the event table (up to 1000) and then continues live, so a dropped connection
  loses nothing.
- A comment line arrives every 15 seconds so idle proxies do not close it.
- The payload is deliberately small. For an event's full payload, call
  **`GET /internal/events/:id`**.
- At most 20 concurrent streams; the 21st gets a 503. One stream per dashboard
  process, fanned out to browsers by you — not one per open tab.

### 3. Queue

**`GET /internal/jobs?name&state&limit&cursor`** and
**`GET /internal/jobs/:id`**. On demand, plus the overview's queue section for
the counts.

States are pg-boss's: `created`, `retry`, `active`, `completed`, `cancelled`,
`failed`. A failed job carries its error in `output`. When a job's data names a
message or a delivery, the row carries that owner's `tenantId` and `tenantName`.

**`POST /internal/jobs/:id/retry`** puts a `failed` job back. Any other state is
a 409 — a job that is still going does not need help, and a completed one would
run twice.

**`GET /internal/schedules`** lists the crons with their cron strings, when each
last completed and how it went.

### 4. Per-tenant

**`GET /internal/tenants`** for the list with 24-hour counts, and
**`GET /internal/tenants/:id`** for one: its channels (redacted), template
names, rule counts by kind, webhook endpoints, and counts over 24h, 7d and 30d.

Drill down with the feeds, all filtered by `tenantId`:
**`/internal/messages`**, **`/internal/events`**, **`/internal/redemptions`**,
**`/internal/invites`**.

### 5. Message detail

**`GET /internal/messages?…`** already gives each row a `timeline` — its own
events in order — so the list answers "what happened to this?" without a click.

**`GET /internal/messages/:id`** gives the rest: every event, the delivery
reports with the provider's raw body, the fallback children, and the parent if
this message is itself a fallback. This is the view for "why did this not
arrive?", and the raw body is usually the answer.

### 6. Deliveries

**`GET /internal/webhook-deliveries?status=failed`** across every tenant, with
the event type and the endpoint URL. Attempts run at 1m, 5m, 30m, 2h and 12h
before a delivery is marked `failed`.

**`POST /internal/webhook-deliveries/:id/replay`** queues it again, for any
tenant including the platform endpoint.

### 7. Campaigns

**`GET /internal/campaigns?tenantId&status`**, polled every 5 seconds, and
**`GET /internal/campaigns/:id`** for one campaign with every run.

The list shows each campaign's status, `nextRunAt`, and the latest run's
counts. The detail shows the run history with a progress bar — the run's
`queued + blocked + skipped` over its `audienceSize`, both from the API — and,
for the selected run, **`GET /internal/campaigns/:id/runs/:runId/recipients?state=`**:
who got it, who did not, and why. The overview's `campaigns` section is the
card on the front page.

## Charts

**`GET /internal/metrics?series=&bucket=&window=&tenantId=&groupBy=`**

`series` is `messages`, `events`, `redemptions` or `searches`; `bucket` is
`hour` or `day`; `groupBy` is `status` or `channel` for messages, `status` for
redemptions, `type` for events. Returns `{ bucket, series: [{ key, points: [[ts, count]] }] }`.

Enough for a chart and nothing more. It is not a metrics system, and if you
need percentiles or retention, read the event log into something that is.

## Refresh model

| View | How |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | poll every 10s |
| Live feed | SSE, always connected |
| Queue | on demand, plus a poll while someone is watching a retry |
| Per-tenant | on demand |
| Message detail | on demand |
| Deliveries | on demand |

## What is not here

No write endpoints beyond retry and replay. No per-tenant dashboard routes —
tenants already have their own scoped lists under `/v1`. No HTML. If the
dashboard needs something the engine does not expose, add a read endpoint here
rather than reaching into the database: direct database access is how two
sources of truth start.
